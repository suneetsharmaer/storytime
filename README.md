# storytime
There was once a place where people told stories with vivid imagination and an allure that trapped all listeners into an imaginarium of anticipatory turbulence.  However, as time passed, culture evolved, and people became obsessed with immediate gratification, the art of storytelling slowly eroded.  Stories need to be told; stories inspire, teach, and ultimately reveal humanity in all its completeness.  Story Time utilizes the Houndify API, server side database, and a web hosting server to create a browser based product by turning any story into a visual experience.  As you tell your story, your device listens and the Houndify API will send the speech to Story Time where it picks up the keywords, searches for an image of that keyword, and displays the image onto the browser.
